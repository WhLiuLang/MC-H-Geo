## üîç Introduction
**MC-H-Geo** is a novel framework for **fine-grained lithological classification of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) outcrop point clouds**.  
It integrates **multi-scale contextual feature engineering**, a **Gated Expert Classifier**, and a **two-step geological post-processing** strategy to achieve geologically consistent lithological mapping at the microfacies scale.

This repository provides the source code, demo data, and scripts to reproduce the core results presented in our article.

</p>

**Workflow:**
1. **Anchor Point Construction** ‚Äì voxelize the outcrop into 10 mm grids and generate anchor points.  
2. **Multi-scale Contextual Feature Engine** ‚Äì extract spectral, geometric, textural, frequency-domain, and cross-scale differential features at 10 cm and 30 cm scales.  
3. **Gated Expert Classifier** ‚Äì  
   - Stage 1: Random Forest for vegetation‚Äìrock separation.  
   - Stage 2: Stacking ensemble (RF + XGBoost + MLP, fused by logistic regression) for mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone discrimination.  
4. **Two-step Geological Post-processing** ‚Äì stratigraphic Z-axis correction + neighborhood smoothing for geologically coherent outputs.
